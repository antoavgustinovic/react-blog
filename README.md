# Instructions

For the app to work locally, you need to set the value for the `VITE_X_AUTH`, `VITE_EMAIL`,
`VITE_PASSWORD` environment variables in the `.env` file and then run the command: `npm run dev` in your terminal. Once the app runs, you can log in with the email and password you set up in the environment variables.
